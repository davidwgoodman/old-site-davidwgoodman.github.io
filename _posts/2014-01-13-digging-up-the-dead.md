title: Digging up the Dead
---

This is a [heartbreaking but inspiring episode of Crossing Continents](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nt864) - it follows teams of volunteers in Russia who are trying to find the remains of the over 4 million Red Army soldiers who are still officially listed as Missing in Action. 

It's a tough listen, but it is worth it. It would be easy for a country as badly battered as Russia was to want to forget, but it's inspiring to hear about the young people trying to find these long lost soldiers and put them to rest.

**Edit:** There's also this [fantastic BBC Magazine article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25589709).
