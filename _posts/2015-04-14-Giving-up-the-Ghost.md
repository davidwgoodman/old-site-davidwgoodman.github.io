I’ve migrated my blog back to Tumblr, after a year-and-a-bit using the hosted version of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), a really nice Markdown blogging service.

While I’m an advocate of paying for stuff that matters to you, I hadn’t actually written anything on my site for nearly seven months, after a serious splurge of very long posts around the referendum.

I’ve given up arguing politics on the internet for the medium to long term, and it struck me that it really wasn’t worth the £60 a year or so I was paying just to be able to edit stuff in Markdown and keep an archive of how badly I was disappointed last year. Especially as Tumblr now has a Markdown editor built in.

So, I’ve disabled my Ghost account and manually transferred a year’s worth of posts back over to Tumblr (minus a couple of crap posts about Youtube videos). It was weird reading over last year’s posts. The past really is a different country.

If you follow a link in any of my posts and it doesn’t work, it’s probably a result of this move. I’ll try and fix any I spot. I’ll also try and post a little more often, on subjects other than politics.
