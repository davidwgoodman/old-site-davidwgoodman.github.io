I think the antidote to this is to imagine, even a hundred years ago, gosh, even fifty - what would they have made of the things we consider mundane?

Always a good excuse to link to one of my favourite MetaFilter posts ever - ['Modern Civilisation is the Shit'](http://www.metafilter.com/83597/Money-Get-Away#2668827).
