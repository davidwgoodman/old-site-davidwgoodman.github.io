title: Trying out Jekyll

I'm switching my website over to a static site generator called Jekyll

After a year or so of having all my old posts gathering dust over on Tumblr, I got curious about static site generators again, based largely on [this post](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2016/04/03/static-and-free.html) about the benefits of having a completely static, non-database website.

I've quite enjoyed figuring it out.

Will update this post before I actually switch my domain over.
