A few thoughts on changing priorities, laying down pens and climbing up hills. 

For a little under three years, I've been running a small, genre-focused writing group in Edinburgh called the [Edinburgh Genre Group](http://www.edinburghgenrewriters.org). I started it after being frustrated at not being able to find an active writing group reading and sharing the kind of thing that I wanted to write. I met some of the folks from the [Glasgow SF Writer's Circle](https://gsfwc.wordpress.com/) who walked me through how they ran their group - it's been going thirty years or so, so they were clearly doing something right.

It has been a lot of fun running the group and EGG (as I've taken to calling it) now has a pretty great group of regulars. But over time I realised my heart really wasn't in running it anymore and the group deserved better. So now a couple of the other members have volunteered to try and take the group forward. If you're in or around Edinburgh and you want to get [Milford-style critiques](http://cascadewriters.com/milford-style-workshopping/) then you should fit right in. Send them an email and go along to a meeting. You'll love it.

The truth is, after about four and a half years of establishing a solid, repeatable writing habit (after basically faffing for a decade), I've drafted six novel length works and a handful of short stories. I'm happy with none of them and I was gradually becoming less and less excited by the prospect of bashing out my five hundred words a day. It's time to take a long and possibly permanent break from that and try something new. 

I'm still going to write - it'll just be here, in public. And instead of exploring the economics of post-scarcity societies (or more often blowing up space stations, if I'm honest) I'm going to return to something that has been a fascination of mine since childhood - travel and the outdoors.

I've been hillwalking since I was old enough to pull on a pair of boots. Through my time at university I was lucky enough to do a lot of adventure training as part of the [Officer's Training Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officers%27_Training_Corps), including memorable expeditions in the Cairngorms. Then I moved to London and, apart from a few trips to the South Downs and tromping through muddy forests in Essex, didn't do much for years. All my gear broke, got borrowed or went missing and I just sort of... stopped climbing hills.

But since moving back to Edinburgh, I've slowly (oh *so* slowly) started again. And recently, I've been thinking about doing far more in the outdoors. I mean, sometimes you just have to listen to your gut. And *my* gut tells me that traipsing up hills makes me a very happy man. Here's me on Allermuir a couple of weeks ago:

Sometimes things you want to do feel good *because* they're the right thing to do. It's always worth checking with yourself if the thing you *think* is your ambition actually still is. It might actually be something else entirely that really makes you happy.

So, I've reactivated my [Mountain Training account](http://www.mountain-training.org/) which I registered in a previous burst of enthusiasm for the hills a full decade ago(!) and I'm now logging my way towards the [Mountain Leader award](http://www.mountain-training.org/walking/skills-and-awards/mountain-leader), one weekend hillwalk at a time. This rather good wee video from Mountain Training explains the qualification quite nicely.

So, this site will more than likely feature a lot more of the things I want to write about now. That will mean the odd gear review (I'm a bit of a gearhead, frankly), walk reports, updates on my progress through the ML process and hopefully the odd bit of writing about the outdoors on a more metaphysical and meaningful level. 

I've been inspired recently by the writings of a few other outdoor bloggers, including [Alex Roddie](http://www.alexroddie.com/), [David Lintern](http://www.davidlintern.com/) and [Al Humphreys](http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/). It was Al's [concept of microadventures](http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/microadventures-3/) that really made me think that getting back into the outdoors might be possible in lots of small steps instead of a few great galumphing ones. As a non-driver in a full time job, I'm particularly interested in figuring out ways of getting out and about in Scotland and wild camping/backpacking via public transport at the weekends. If I figure out any particularly great ways to do it, I'll be writing them up here.

All of this means I should hopefully be writing more here generally. There will still probably be the odd bit of technical noodling and waffling about science fiction and gaming, but it'll mostly be hills. I hope you enjoy reading.
