I’ve been following French cartoonist Boulet for a while. He’s been doing some amazing work, but this recent piece really struck a chord with me.

He’s used animation to incredible effect. If you ever took a long car journey as a child, or, like me, commuted with your parents, you’ll appreciate this.
