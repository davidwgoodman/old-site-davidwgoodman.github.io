title: Cool Finnish SF short - Tuntematon redux
---
I just came across a neat little [Finnish SF short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2AZVFl0E2g), set in an alternate dieselpunk continuation of the Winter War.

I'd love to know if the references to 'perch' and 'bread and butter' are Finnish in-jokes, but I really enjoyed this short film. A lot of it reminded me of the art of the [Scythe board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe) and upcoming [Iron Harvest computer game](https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/3/13512952/iron-harvest-diesel-punk-rts-scythe-king-art-games), both worked on by Polish artist [Jakub Różalski](https://www.facebook.com/Kubasa/media_set?set=a.791234740900287.1073741829.100000413065363&type=3).

I sometimes get frustrated when short films like this start to sketch out a world I really want to see more of, but then end after a few minutes. But one of the cool things about the plummeting entry cost of filmmaking and other creative tools is that a few folks can get together in the Finnish back country for a weekend and make something like this. Give it a watch.
