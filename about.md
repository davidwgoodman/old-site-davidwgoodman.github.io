I'm Dave Goodman. I write about writing, the outdoors, occasionally photography and the odd computer game. Sometimes politics, but I'm trying to do less of that.

I'm Happy Dave on Flickr, Metafilter and a bunch of forums. If you find something online written under that name, chances are that I wrote it.

I try to get out in the hills as often as I can, which isn't as often as I'd like. I spend too much money on camping gear.


### Where?

I live and work in Edinburgh, Scotland. It's a beautiful place. You should totally visit.
